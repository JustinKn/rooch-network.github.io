Rooch will work closely with zkMove to bring its zk-rollup solution to Rooch\u2019s fully interoperable, multi-chain ecosystem. Moreover we will explore new dApp usages and build the Move community together.\\n\\nZero-knowledge rollups or zk-rollups are a next-gen Layer2 scaling solution that enable blockchains to validate transactions faster and maintain low gas fees compared to traditional Layer 1s via a combination of on and off-chain processes. \\n\\nzkMove is a zk-proof friendly Move language runtime environment. The initial idea of zkMove is to improve the programmability and composability of zk-proofs technology. \\n\\nSome highlights of zkMove: \\n1. A type safe zero-knowledge proof-friendly bytecode virtual machine \\n2. No compromise on performance while pursuing Turing completeness\\n3. Safe and efficient scaling and privacy engine\\n\\nFor those readers interested in a deep dive into zkMove, there is a wealth of high quality information available at the zkMove medium (https://zkmove.medium.com/). The project is also hiring qualified engineers (https://www.zkmove.net/join_us.html)!\\n\\nRooch Network is committed to its partnership with zkMove, and together we will work to deliver the holy grail of blockchain on Rooch~ a fully interoperable, multi-chain ecosystem supported in part by zkMove\u2019s layered solution."},{"id":"/2023/2/9/Partnership-Announcement-MoveBit","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/2/9/Partnership-Announcement-MoveBit","editUrl":"https://github.com/rooch-network/rooch-network.github.io/edit/main/blog/2023-2-9-Partnership-Announcement-MoveBit.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-2-9-Partnership-Announcement-MoveBit.md","title":"Partnership Announcement~ MoveBit <> Rooch","description":"logo-4","date":"2023-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 9, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":0.89,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Partnership Announcement~ MoveBit <> Rooch"},"prevItem":{"title":"Partnership Announcement~ zkMove <> Rooch","permalink":"/blog/2023/2/10/Partnership-Announcement-zkMove"},"nextItem":{"title":"Partnership Announcement~ MoveFunsDao <> Rooch","permalink":"/blog/2023/2/7/Partnership-Announcement-MoveFunsDAO"}},"content":"![logo-4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99104408/217911743-1d9f34bd-d79a-4ccb-bbb6-9f8460845b36.png)\\nRooch Network will partner with MoveBit to ensure the highest possible level of security independently verified by an expert third party.
