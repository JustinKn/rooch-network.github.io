# Rooch - Towards Web3 Native DApps

There are already more than a dozen of great Web3 infrastructures who are constantly breaking the boundary of blockchain technology and trying to take our industry a step further toward the dream of Web3.

In this brief article you will find our vision regarding Web3 and why do we want to build Rooch.

## Web3 Native DApp

The adjective "Web3 Native" comes from the term "[Cloud Native](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cloud-native/what-is-cloud-native/)". It refers to the DApps that takes full advantage of decentralization provided by the blockchain technology, which makes it a 100% Web3 DApplication.

Below are the architecture of the most current Web3 App (Hybrid Web3 App) and the one of the DApp that we envision (Web3 Native DApp).

A Hybrif Web3 App usually adopts the same architecture of a Web2 App where the user send requests from the frontend to the backend server and the server does the computation and storage. The only different it makes is that, in the backend server, there is a private key which operates tokens on a decentralized blockchain "on behalf of" the users.

To compare with, A Web3 Native DApp does not have a centralized private key controlling users' assets. The backend of the DApp is fully implemented in a smart contract runtime, where the logics defined by the contracts controls everything from the users' assets to the functionality of the DApp.

## Breakdown with 6 Questions

Here's a table that shows the differences these two types of Web3 architecture will bring to the end users.

### Does user own their data and state?

### Can governance make actual changes?

### Are the assets secured by trust or verification?

### Is it censorship resistant?

### How's the performance and user experience?

## Examples

## Why Rooch?

### Move Language

### Modular Blockchain
