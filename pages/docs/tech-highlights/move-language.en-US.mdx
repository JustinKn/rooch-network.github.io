Move is an open-source smart contract programming language originally designed and developed by Diem.

The name `Move` came from the [Move Semantics in C++](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3106110/what-is-move-semantics), where it is used to move resources from one object to another without copying. This design purpose fits right in the context of a smart contract lanague, and makes it a perfect choice to achieve the flexibility and safety of crypto assets.

## Why Move for Rooch?

Here are the reasons why Rooch adopts Move as the smart contract language:

- **Resource Oriented Programming** - which is a new smart contract development paradigm introduced and enabled by Move Language, this enables a broader design space for Web3 application.
- **Safety** - The [type ability system of Move](https://move-book.com/advanced-topics/types-with-abilities.html) provides language level safety to the smart contract assets; in addition, Move Language has a native formal verification tool called [Move Prover](https://github.com/move-language/move/blob/main/language/move-prover/doc/user/prover-guide.md), which potentially could reduce the cost for smart contract security audits
- **Collectively Built by Communities** - As a new programming language, Move is promoted by more than just one communities and projects. (See [Awesome-Move](https://awesome-move.com/#move-powered-blockchains) for a list of Move powered blockchains)
- **Rich Crypto Native Features** - Move Language has built-in support for features such as contract upgradability and account abstraction.
