# Rooch Network

Rooch Network is an all-in-one Web3 infrastructure solution that release you from infrastructure constraints and empower you with rich features, so that you can be laser focused on building you DApp.

- [**Rooch**](/docs/rooch-network/rooch) - A modular off-chain smart contract runtime environment with Move Language
- [**Rooch Layer2**](/docs/rooch-network/rooch-layer2) - A general pupose smart contract platform using Rooch as execution layer and Ethereum as consensus layer
- [**Rooch Layer3**](/docs/rooch-network/rooch-layer3) - A DApp hosting platform that enables (customized) DApp-Specific-Platforms using Rooch as DApp containers

## Why Rooch Network?

There are already more than a dozen of great Web3 infrastructures who are constantly breaking the boundary of blockchain technology and trying to bring mass adoption to the decentralized world.

However, we see two issues among all these solutions:

- Necessary technologies and features are scattered among different infras
- Infra projects focuses too much on technology advancements over developer and user experiences

That is why we want to build an all-in-one solution that can let devs focuses on their innovations.

For this purpose, we ask 2 questions:

- How do we ensure there are no constraints in terms of throughput rate (measured by TPS), Gas Fee, and storage?
- How can we provide features to enable new design patterns that inspires innovations as well as eliminate pain points to improve developer and user experiences

Our answer is that we should adopt the goold old layering and modularization methodology for the architecture design and employ a programming language that offers most flexibility and crypto native features.

Thus we have the final solution of Rooch Network:  
**Move Language + Modular Execution Runtime (Constructing Layer2 and Layer3 Networks)**
