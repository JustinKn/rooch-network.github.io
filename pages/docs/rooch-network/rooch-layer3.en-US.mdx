# Rooch Layer3

Rooch Layer3 is a DApp hosting platform for developers to deploy their DApps contained with Rooch instances.

> The key difference between Rooch Layer2 (DApp hosting) and Rooch Layer3 (smart contract hosting):
>
> - On Layer2, all smart contracts of different DApps are deployed in the same Rooch instance
> - On Layer3, smart contracts of each DApps are deployed in a single Rooch instance

## Why Layer3?

### DApp-Specific-Platforms

Comparing with Layer2, where all DApps share the resources provided by a single platform, Layer3 allows DApps to have DApp-Specific-Platforms. This brings even larger scalability to Layer3 DApps.

Layer3 DApps can also customize the their Rooch instance to achieve other features, such as privacy.

### Easy Deployment

Comparing with AppChain, where developers need to find their own node operators to provide security for their own blockchains, Layer3 can realize one-click deployment as simple as pushing your code to GitHub.
