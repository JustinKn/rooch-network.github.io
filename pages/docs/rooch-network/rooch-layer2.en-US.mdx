# Rooch Layer2

Rooch Layer2 is a Move Language based general purpose smart contract platform.

## Architecture

Rooch Layer2 is an off-chain network composed of Rooch on top of Ethereum using it as the security and settlement layer.

The initial version of Rooch Layer2 will be secured with [Fraud Proof](/docs/tech-highlights/fraud-proof). In the future we will also introduce [Hybrid Security enabled by ZK Proof](/docs/tech-highlights/hybrid-security).

**In the Off-Chain part:**

- **Data Availability** - The importance of DA is to ensure anyone can get access to all the transactions happened in the off-chain environment. The solution of DA in Rooch Layer2 has two parts:
  - The Sequencer will store a copy of all the transactions which will be permissionless to access at a high TPS
  - A 3rd party DA Chain will be employed to store transactions with a relative lower TPS but strong availability assurance
- **Sequencer** - The Sequencer is in charge of verifying incoming transactions and ordering them. The ordered transaction will be submitted to DA Chain and Proposer.
- **Proposer** - Proposer is responsible for execute the ordered transactions and commit the result state to Ethereum.
- **Challenger** - The Challenger is the guardians of the Rooch Layer2 network. Challenger constantly monitor the transaction stream and also execute them to calculate state transistions. If they calculated state result does not match with the proposed state to Ethereum, the Challenger shall request the farud proofs and submit for arbitration.

**On Ethereum** there are 4 functions implemented with smart contracts:

- **Arbitration** - Arbitration contract acts as the "court" for arbitrating suspicious state transistions happend in the off-chain Rooch.
- **State Commitment Chain** - State of the Rooch Layer2 network will be commited to Ethereum forming a chain of state commitment.
- **Bridge** - Bridge contract hosts all the assets that are deposited to Rooch Layer2.
- **L1ToL2 Transaction Queue** - This contract is a portal for users to submit transactions from Layer1 directly, in the case that the user is maliciously rejected by the node operator of Rooch Layer2 network.

## Why Layer2?

### Scalability

The technology of Layer2 mainly construct a way to port security and decentralizatioin from a public permissionless blockchain to an off-chain system for aggregated state transition calculation. As Layer2 is an off-chain system, it is almost limitless in terms of TPS, Gas Fee, and Storage, which is exactly the challenge that Rooch Network is trying to tackle.

### Fully Contract-Based DApp

Since being a limitless execution environment, a DApp can fully design and implement its backend logics and storage space using smart contracts. Such applications can be truely decentralized, cesorship resistant and enjoy the asset composability.
