# Rooch

Rooch is a smart contract execution runtime with the following features:

- **MoveVM** - Rooch embeds a full MoveVM and the smart contracts are programmed with Move Language
- **Provable** - Rooch can produce per-step execution proof for proving the integrity of state transitions
- **Modular** - Rooch has abstracted interfaces which allows different DA Layer, Settlement Layer and Arbitration Layer to tap in

- **RPC** - RPC component provides access endpoint for users and developers to upload Move modulars as well as send transactions to call contracts and native functions
  > **RPC Proxy** is for interprating differernt transaction structure to the native schema for allowing users to send transaction directly from versatile wallets. E.g. users can directly send transaction from MetaMask.
- **MoveOS** - MoveOS is the component that does all the computational and storage work
- **Role Specific Modules** - These are the funcational modules that allow node operators to config their nodes as different roles in a Layer2 or a Layer3 network
- **Interfaces** - Rooch has built-in interfaces to work with different layers.
  > Interfaces being abstracted enough ensures that Rooch will be able to adapt to different ecosystems. E.g. Use arbitrary DA layer; deploy Rooch as Layer2 on arbitrary Layer1s.
