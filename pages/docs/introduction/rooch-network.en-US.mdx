# Rooch Network

Rooch Network provides robust, all-in-one services for Web3 DApps to easily and flexibly deploy. This allows Web3 developers to focus on building cool stuff without worrying about infrastructure.

## Execution Layer

Execution Layer is composed of all the DApps using Rooch as containers and smart contract execution environment.

Depending on the scenarios and resoure requirements, there are 3 types of usage of Rooch:

- **General Purpose Platform** - We will launch and maintain a Rooch instance that serves as a general purpose smart contract platform. DApps and developers will be able to deploy their smart contract directly onto an existing platform. The development experience will just be like working on a Layer1 blockchain but with much higher TPS, lower Gas Fee as well as larger and more convenient storage
- **DApp Specific Platform** - DApps who wants to have a customized platform can launch a dedicated Rooch instance, where builders can define customized and other specialized features such as tokenomics.
- **Sector Specific Platform** - Web3 builders who want to develop and scale their ecosystem with multiple DApps can also launch a Rooch instance where assets and functionalities of different DApps will have seamless interoperability and users can share accounts and profiles across different ecosystem DApps.

## Network Middleware

Rooch Network has several essential middleware services who are in charge of processing transactions and states for all the Rooch instances on the execution layer. Each of the services are based on the same core Rooch implementations.

- **Sequencer** - Sequencer is in charge of verifying incoming transactions and ordering them. The ordered transaction will be submitted to DA Chain and Proposer.
- **Challenger** - Challenger is the guardians of the Rooch Layer2 network. Challenger constantly monitor the transaction stream and also execute them to calculate state transistions. If they calculated state result does not match with the proposed state to the Arbitration Layer, the Challenger shall request the farud proofs and submit for arbitration.  
  (See [Fraud Proof](/docs/tech-highlights/fraud-proof) for more information)
- **ZK Prover** - ZK Prover generates ZK Proofs for state transitions based on the batched transactions. The Proof will be sent to the Arbitration Layer to optimize the challenge period required by the security mechanism.  
  (See [Hybrid Security with ZK Proof](/docs/tech-highlights/hybrid-security) for more information)
- **Proposer** - Proposer is responsible for executing all the ordered transactions and commit the result state to the Arbitration Layer.

## DA Layer

The importance of DA (Data Availability) is to ensure anyone can get access to all the transactions happened in the off-chain environment.

Rooch Network will adopt a 3rd party solution to ensure the availability of the transactions and maintain a high TPS. We are still researching different candidates which includes [Celestia](https://celestia.org/), [Eigenlayer](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/), [Polygon Avail](https://polygon.technology/blog-tags/polygon-avail), and [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

## Arbitration Layer

Arbitration Layer acts as the "court" for arbitrating and verifying all state transitions happened in different Rooch instances containing different DApps.

In the Rooch Network, Ethereum takes the role of arbitration layer and will be the sole source of security for all DApps in the Rooch Ecosystem. The rationale here is that Ethereum has the highest practical attack cost, measured by its market cap.

On Ethereum there are 3 smart contracts serving different roles:

- **Fraud Proof Arbitration contract**, which accepts fraud proofs and emulate the execution of the state transition to make a decision on slashing.
- **ZK Verifier** contract is responsible for verifying the ZK Proofs submitted by the ZK Prover.
- **State Commitment Chain** keeps a chain of record of all the states committed by the Proposer.

## Settlement Layer

Settlement Layer provides state settlement for all Rooch based DApps. Every DApps using Rooch as the execution environment will be able to migrate assets(i.e. tokens) between their DApp and different Layer1s.

Rooch Network supports integrating arbitrary Layer1s to be a part of the Settlement Layer, all using Ethereum as the source of security guarantee. (See [Multi-Chain Settlement](/docs/tech-highlights/multi-chain-settlement) for more information)
